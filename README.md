- 👋 Hi, my real name is Grzegorz Kmita. I'm 19 years old, preapring for my school leave exam in order to study Computer Science.
- Note: my website is a side project, not working on it anymore. If I were to I would change too many things about it.
- 👀 I’m interested in Game Development and any programming in general. So any job offers I would highly appreciate. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python alongside with Excel and SQL.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with some more familiar with Game Development than I am and build some games together, whilst publishing them on Game Jams.
- 📫 How to reach me grzegorzkmita@protonmail.com, Discord: Jirafey#8858
